 * 1- all http requests will be intercepted by the dispatcher servlet mentioned in web.xml
 * 2- dispatcher servlet passes the request to the handler mapping
 * 3- the handler mapping determines the controller to be used
 * 4- Requests are now processed by the Controller and response is returned to DispatcherServlet.
 * 5- the controller returns a ModelAndView object or the name of the view. the ContentNegotiatingResolver will be used
 * to find the correct data representation
 * 6- the last step can be omitted by directly returning the data in the controller using the annotation
 * @ResponseBody
 * remarque : using the annotation Spring4 @RestController instead of @Controller we can omit the annotation
 * @ResponseBody because it is already used in the @RestController annotation.
