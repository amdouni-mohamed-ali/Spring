# MVC Module

In this project, we will show some examples using spring mvc.

## Project structure

```
mvc
└─── mvn-boot
└─── mvc-spring
|    └─── mvc-spring-1
|    └─── mvc-spring-2
|
```

The mvn-boot is an example of how the setup a web application using spring boot (with an embedded tomcat).
The mvc-spring are examples of how to setup a web application but the packaging will be a war this time.
